# Overview
This is a simple website that tells people how to go to Hell.

## Hells
There are four circles of hell:
- Hell, Michigan, USA
- Hell, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands
- Hell, Trøndelag, Norway
- Hell, Gelderland, Netherlands

<sup>Sorry Dante!</sup>

The site will automatically select the closest one, but it's possible to choose one manually.
